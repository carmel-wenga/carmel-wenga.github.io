### Machine Learning Engineer

1. **Image-Based Search Engine** (Research Project - In Progress) : This projet aims to allow users to search projects based on a given uploaded image on [ShoppingList](https://shoppinglist.cm) e-commerce website. This will also be an improvement of the actual image-based recommender system.

    This is a Master thesis reseach project applied to ShoppingList. I am working on this project as Supervisor's assistant and Research Lead.
    
    ***Keywords*** : Search Engine, Image Processing, Deep Learning, Features Extraction, Image Classification, Image Segmentation.
    
    Estimated project duration : **10 Months**

2. **Collaborative Filtering Recommender System** (Research Project - In Progress) : I am working on a collaborative filtering based recommender system that will be applied to [ShoppingList](https://shoppinglist.cm) e-commerce website. Until now, I have implemented several collaborative filtering algorithms, and my experimentations are available on this [Git repository](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering). Implemented algorithms are the followings :
    - [User-based Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering/blob/master/2.%20user-based%20collaborative%20filtering.ipynb)
    - [Item-Based Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering/blob/master/3.%20item-based%20collaborative%20filtering.ipynb)
    - [SVD for Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering/blob/master/4.%20Singular%20Value%20Decomposition.ipynb)
    - [Matrix Factorization](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering/blob/master/5.%20Regularized%20SVD%20(Matrix%20Factorization).ipynb)
    - [Neural Network Based-Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/review-on-collaborative-filtering/blob/master/6.%20neural%20networks%20matrix%20factorization.ipynb)
    
    Technologies used : Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Numpy, Pandas, Scipy
    
    I also carry out this work as part of my PhD thesis.

3. **[Image-Based Recommender System](https://shoppinglist.cm)** : Since users in e-commerce website are attracted by images, this project was designed to recommend products with similar images. This recommender system has been deployed on [ShoppingList](https://shoppinglist.cm) e-commerce website. [Here](https://shoppinglist.cm/fr/search/detail/pyjama-7-pieces/) is an example of product recommendation based on the product's image.

Technologies used:
> - Python
> - Tensorflow 
> - Keras 
> - nmslib 
> - Scikit-Learn

    I have open-source the code of this system through this [Github repository](https://github.com/nzhinusoftcm/Image-Based-RS). I am still working on this project. The work consists mainly of updating and improving the system to get better performance.
